            <h2>About KitchenAids</h2>
            <hr>
            <P>Hello, my name is Brynn. I am a 22 year old Web Developer and this is my first Laravel project. I have been a developer and designer for the past 2 years now, but I was primarilly working with WordPress and designing custom WordPress themes. Recently, I started working with Laravel and this is my first real project.</P>
            <p>The goal with KitchenAids was mostly to leran how the Laravel framework works, but also to make something I would actually use.</p>
            <p>Over the last few years I have spent a lot of time cooking, and in that time I have created a lot of my own recipes. Originally I was storing them in Google Docs to access from my phone while cooking, but that wasn't a very clean way of doing things.</p>
            <p>So with KitchenAids, I wanted to design something that would be easy to utilize, and mobile friendly.</p>
            <p>And there you have it, the story of my simplistic first laravel app. If you have any questions, comments, concerns, or just want to send me a funny joke, feel free to shoot me a message via the <a href="/contact" title="Contact Us">Contact Page</a>.</p>
            <p>Thanks for checking out KitchenAids!</p>
